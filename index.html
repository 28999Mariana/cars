                            Mitsubishi Motors is one of the divisions of the Japanese corporation Mitsubishi. At the end of World War I, this division was created that originally manufactured aircraft engines, which came to be used in World War II. Mitsubishi means "three diamonds" and refers to the three diamond logo that was adopted in March 1873 by the first company in the Mitsubishi group. The logo, in its current form, has been registered since 1914. In 1917 it became the first Japanese automobile company to manufacture a series car in Japan, the “A” model.

                            Toyota Motor Corporation, simply called Toyota, is a Japanese automobile manufacturer headquartered in Toyota (Aichi), Japan. Toyota was the largest automaker in 2012 (by production) with global sales of approximately 9.8 million vehicles. However, it did not have this leadership in 2011, when there was a strong industrial recession in Japan, as a consequence of the earthquake that occurred on March 11 of that year and which, among other things, affected the town of Fukushima. Because of this, Toyota fell back to third place, giving up the lead to General Motors itself and to Volkswagen, which ranked second.
